'''
The Models folder consists of files representing trained/retrained models as
part of build jobs, etc. The model names can be appropriately set as
projectname_date_time or project_build_id (in case the model is created as part
of build jobs). Another approach is to store the model files in a separate storage
such as AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or any other form of storage.
